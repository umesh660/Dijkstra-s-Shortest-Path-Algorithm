# TfL Journey Planner README

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a Python program to compute the shortest path within the Transport for London (TfL) rail network using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The team implemented three versions of the code using pure Python, NetworkX, and Pandas to ensure accuracy and robustness.

## Implementation
- Pure Python implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Structured the NetworkX code and documentation.
- Developed the Pandas code, edited the document, and integrated the code segments.
- Completed the NetworkX code, edited the document, and combined the codes.

## Workflow Summary

### Roles and Contributions
- **Pure Python Implementation**: Developed the core algorithm in pure Python.
- **NetworkX Implementation**: Focused on the NetworkX implementation and documentation.
- **Pandas Implementation**: Worked on the Pandas version and document editing.
- **Integration and Finalization**: Finalized the NetworkX code, document editing, and integration.

### Challenges
- Converting subway network data into a usable format.
- Overcoming failures in complex nested logic and functions through teamwork.

### Meeting Minutes
- **Date**: 21/12/2023
- **Time**: 14:00
- **Participants**: All members participated online.
- **Discussion**: Planned collaborative coding and validation tasks, assigning clear roles. Agreed to develop three code versions for cross-verification.

## Algorithm Summary

### Testing
- Initial tests on smaller problems verified the algorithm's correctness.
- Conversion of the graph into a dictionary, list, or dataframe format.
- Successful output using Waterloo as the start station and Paddington as the destination.

### Full Application
- Applied to the entire London metro network.
- Correct outputs for routes from Waterloo, Victoria, Holborn, and Bank to Paddington.

### Other Graph Applications
- Modify parameters for different graphs.
- Convert the graph into a dataframe.
- Example applications show successful adaptation to different graph structures.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Pure Python Implementation**: Run the script to use the Dijkstra's Algorithm implemented in pure Python.
2. **NetworkX Implementation**: Ensure the NetworkX library is installed and run the corresponding script for the graph-based implementation.
3. **Pandas Implementation**: Ensure the Pandas library is installed and run the script that uses dataframes for graph representation.

Each version has been tested and verified for accuracy, ensuring reliable results for the shortest path computation within the TfL rail network.
